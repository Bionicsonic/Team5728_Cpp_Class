//1.3 Comments
/*
Im doing comments right now! As you can see using the '//' indicates to 
a program, that the particular line is commented out. Whereas using the
'/ *' and '* /' as shown above and below this comment will comment out
anything inbetween those two points. These are called delimiters.

You will want to commment on each line of the code you make after a day
of coding. This will allow you to go back and review everything so you
understand what you code is doing and can easily understand it when you
or someone else looks at it again
